                <h1 class="terms__title">Introduction</h1>
                <p class="terms__text">The blockchain ecosystem is rapidly changing, and new and innovative solutions
                    are always emerging.
                    0xMiner is one solution that aims to solve some of the industry's key challenges, such as the lack
                    of secure and profitable investment platforms, the trust and transparency gap in DeFi, and the
                    volatility of crypto-linked assets.</p>

                <h2 class="terms__title">The Problem</h2>
                <p class="terms__text"> Retail investors struggle to find secure crypto platforms with top APY/APR,
                    limiting their passive
                    income opportunities. DeFi platforms are often plagued by trust and transparency issues, which
                    hinder informed investing and deter institutional participation. Additionally, crypto-linked DeFi
                    platforms face price fluctuations, which create uncertainty in asset values and deter cautious
                    users.
                    <br><br><br>
                    1. APY/APR Platform Shortage:
                    Retail investors have long grappled with the scarcity of secure crypto platforms offering attractive
                    Annual Percentage Yield (APY) and Annual Percentage Rate (APR). This shortage limits their ability
                    to generate passive income from their crypto assets.
                    <br><br><br>
                    2. DeFi's Trust & Transparency Issue:
                    The inherent trust gap within the DeFi sector creates uncertainty among investors and discourages
                    institutional participation. The lack of transparency and accountability has been a roadblock to
                    informed investing in crypto platforms.
                    <br><br><br>
                    3. DeFi's Volatility Challenge:
                    The crypto-linked DeFi platforms are often subject to extreme price fluctuations, leading to
                    uncertainty in the valuation of assets. This volatility dissuades cautious users from participating
                    in the DeFi ecosystem.
                    <br><br><br>
                    4. Token Utility & Earnings Gap:
                    A notorious amount of tokens in the crypto space, including meme and gaming coins, lack practical
                    utility and yield opportunities. This deficiency diminishes their adoption and value for token
                    holders.

                <h2 class="terms__title">0xMiner: A Secure And Profitable Crypto Solution</h2>

                    NFT & Bitcoin Fusion
                    0xMiner's NFT & Bitcoin Fusion solution offers investors a unique and innovative way to participate
                    in the Bitcoin mining industry. By purchasing Genesis NFTs, users can gain access to a fraction of a
                    Bitcoin mining farm without having to invest in the hardware, software, and energy required to mine
                    Bitcoin themselves.
                    <br><br><br>
                    0xMiner's NFT mining contracts are backed by real Bitcoin mining ASICS. This makes 0xMiner a secure
                    and transparent way to participate in the Bitcoin mining industry. Additionally, 0xMiner offers some
                    of the industry's highest returns, with up to 75% APRs.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Stability & Global Reach
                    0xMiner is committed to providing a stable and reliable platform for its users, with NFTs backed by
                    real Bitcoin mining ASICS, allowing holders to track their earnings in real-time. Additionally,
                    0xMiner's DeFi-based real world assets (RWA) tokenization helps mitigate crypto-linked asset
                    volatility. 0xMiner is also available to users all over the world making it a truly global platform
                    for investors to earn passive BTC yields securely.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Recovery in Volatile Markets
                    0xMiner's DeFi-based RWA tokenization is a unique feature that allows investors to regain the lost
                    value of tokens in fluctuating markets. This is done by tokenizing the bitcoin mining process: an
                    industrial activity that produces real value . When the value of crypto-linked assets declines,
                    investors can exchange their tokens for RWA tokens backed by real-world assets. This allows
                    investors to preserve their capital and even profit from market volatility.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Enhanced Digital Asset Utility
                    0xMiner is focused on amplifying the utility of various digital assets, including meme, multiverse,
                    and gaming tokens. 0xMiner does this by offering a variety of features that allow users to interact
                    with their digital assets in new and innovative ways. Similar to real estate - own the NFT and earn
                    returns. By enhancing the utility of digital assets, 0xMiner is helping to boost both token value
                    and community engagement.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Effortless Diversification
                    0xMiner is designed to make it easy for investors to diversify their portfolios by offering a
