                <h1 class="terms__title">How it Works</h1>
                <p class="terms__text">
                    0xMiner operates on a simple yet powerful principle, offering cryptocurrency holders the opportunity
                    to mint NFTs that grant access to our cutting-edge mining farm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of
                    how it works:
                </p>

                <h2 class="terms__title">1. NFT Minting:</h2>
                <p class="terms__text">
                    Cryptocurrency holders can mint NFTs on the 0xMiner platform. We proudly present the NFT Genesis 1
                    collection, comprising 500 NFTs, each priced at 2 ETH. These NFTs are strategically designed to
                    target an impressive 300% Bitcoin return over a span of 4 years.
                </p>


                <h2 class="terms__title">2. Accessibility for All:</h2>
                <p class="terms__text">
                    0xMiner's NFT minting is inclusive and open to all. To participate, individuals need a minimum of
                    1000 USDT or an equivalent amount in supported tokens. This modest requirement grants them access to
                    4 years of Bitcoin mining opportunities.
                </p>

                <h2 class="terms__title">3. Earnings Variation:</h2>
                <p class="terms__text">
                    Earnings generated through NFT minting can vary based on the minting price and the overall
                    productivity of our mining farm.
                </p>

                <h2 class="terms__title">4. Secondary Market Trading:</h2>
                <p class="terms__text">
                    For added profit potential, holders have the option to trade their minted NFTs on the market, taking
                    advantage of market dynamics and demand.
                </p>

                <h2 class="terms__title">0xMiner Platform Fees:</h2>
                <p class="terms__text">
                    Genesis 1 NFTs: No fees apply during the Genesis 1 phase.
                    <br><br>
                    Post-launch NFT Minting: A nominal 3% fee is levied for minting NFTs after the Genesis 1 phase.
                    <br><br>
                    Operational Costs: 0xMiner deducts a proportion of Bitcoin for operational expenses during
                    withdrawals.
                    <br><br>
                    Smart Contracts: Gas fees are incurred based on the blockchain network used.
                    <br><br>
                    NFT Secondary Sales: A modest 3% royalty fee is enforced through smart contracts.
                </p>

                <h2 class="terms__title">Vesting and APR Highlights:</h2>
                <p class="terms__text">
                    Immediate Rewards: Gen 1 NFT holders start earning rewards from day one.
                    <br><br>
                    1-Year Vesting: To optimize the mining setup, rewards are locked for a year.
                    <br><br>

                    this is just the beginning; depending on the price of Bitcoin and market conditions, your rewards
                    could soar even higher. This guarantee is a golden opportunity that may not be available to future
                    users when our platform reaches full operation capacity. <br>
                    let's give a concrete example: acquiring a Gen1 NFT is priced at $3,200 based on the current ETH

                    profit. It's important to note that this projection does not account for potential surges in NFT
                    value, providing investors with the flexibility for timely resale.
