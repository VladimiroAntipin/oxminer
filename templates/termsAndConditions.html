                    8. No Fiduciary Duties
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This Agreement does not create or impose any fiduciary or endorsement duties on us. To the fullest
                    extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to
                    you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in
                    equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You
                    further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in
                    this Agreement.

                    9. Assumption of Risk
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By accessing and using our Services, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated
                    with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems and that you have a working knowledge of
                    digital assets (e.g. the usage and intricacies of bitcoin (BTC) and other Ethereum (ETH) or TRON
                    (TRX) token standards (i.e. ERC-20, TRC-20). You further understand that the markets for these
                    digital assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption,
                    speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of
                    transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum or Bitcoin are variable
                    and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge the risk that your digital assets
                    may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to the Smart Contract. You further
                    acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control
                    the Smart Contract, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while
                    accessing or using the Platform. Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility
                    for all of the risks of accessing and using our Services and interacting with the Smart Contract.

                    10. Third-Party Resources and Promotions
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Platform may contain references or links to third-party resources, which include (but are not
                    limited to) information, materials, products, or services that we do not own or control. In
                    addition, third parties may offer promotions related to us. We assume no responsibility for any such
                    resources or promotions. If you access or use any such resources or participate in any such
                    promotions, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement does not apply to
                    your dealings or relationships with any third parties. You expressly relieve us of any and all
                    liability arising from your use of any such third-party resources or participation in any such
                    promotions.

                    11. Release of Claims
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access to and use of our
                    Services and your interaction with the Smart Contract. You further expressly waive and release us
                    from any and all liability, claims, or causes of action arising from or in any way relating to your
                    use of our Service and your interaction with the Smart Contract.

                    12. Indemnity
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You agree to indemnify us (including but not limited to our team members, managers, directors,
                    contractors, agents, affiliates, and subsidiaries) from and against all claims, damages, costs,
                    obligations, and expenses arising from:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    a. your access and use of the Platform;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    b. your violation of any term or condition of this Agreement, the right of any third party, or any
                    other applicable law, rule, or regulation;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    c. any other party’s access and use of the Platform with your assistance or using any device or
                    account that you own or control.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    13. Limitation of Liability
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Under no circumstances shall we or any of our team members, officers, directors, employees,
                    contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any direct, indirect,
                    punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including (but not limited to)
                    damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out of or
                    relating to any access or use of the service, nor will we be responsible for any damage, loss, or
                    injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the service or the
                    information contained within it. We assume no liability or responsibility for situations including
                    (but not limited to):
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    a. errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    b. personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of
                    the Platform;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    c. unauthorized access or use of any secure server or database in our control, or the use of any
                    information or data stored therein;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    d. interruption or cessation of function related to our service;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    e. bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the Platform;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    f. errors or omissions in, or loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content made
                    available through the service;
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    g. the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Third-party institutions or individuals may need to pay a certain fee to use our Platform. The fee
                    is only for the use of the services we offer and does not include the assumption of losses incurred
                    during usage. Under no circumstances shall we or any of our team members, officers, directors,
                    employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any claims,
                    proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on
                    contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised
                    of the possibility of such liability. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain
                    warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages. Accordingly, some of
                    the disclaimers and limitations set forth in this Agreement may not apply to you. This limitation of
                    liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    14. Dispute Resolution
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good-faith
                    negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to
                    info@oxminer.io so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution.
