                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Company processes anonymous data in order to improve the Website, to bring it to perfection.
                    During
                    this procedure OxMiner can incorporate “cookies”, which collect the visitor’s first level domain
                    name,
                    the date and the exact time of access and other informations. The “cookie” alone can’t be used to
                    reveal
                    the identity of the visitor. The “cookie” is a small text file, which is sent to the browser of the
                    visitor and stored on the hard drive of visitor. Cookies don’t damage the computer of the visitor.
                    The
                    browser can be set to indicate when a cookie is received, so the visitor can decide to accept the
                    so-called cookie or not. The Company does not use cookies to collect or manage any information that
                    would allow the identification of the user. For further information, please read our Cookie Policy,
                    an
                    integral part of the OxMiner General Terms and Conditions.

                    OxMiner will only collect and retain personal data that is
                    relevant to the purposes for which the data is collected, and we will not use it in a way that is
                    incompatible with such purposes unless such use has been subsequently authorized by you. We will
                    take
                    reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete
                    and
                    current. We may occasionally contact you to determine that your data is still accurate and current.
                    To
                    secure your personal information processed we save your personal information to backup archives in

                    <br>
                    When we have no longer or no legal basis to process your personal information, we will either delete
                    or
                    anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
                    stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
                    from
                    any further processing until deletion is possible.
