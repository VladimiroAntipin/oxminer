                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The Company processes anonymous data in order to improve the Website, to bring it to perfection.
                                During
                                this procedure OxMiner can incorporate “cookies”, which collect the visitor’s first level domain
                                name,
                                the date and the exact time of access and other informations. The “cookie” alone can’t be used to
                                reveal
                                the identity of the visitor. The “cookie” is a small text file, which is sent to the browser of the
                                visitor and stored on the hard drive of visitor. Cookies don’t damage the computer of the visitor.
                                The
                                browser can be set to indicate when a cookie is received, so the visitor can decide to accept the
                                so-called cookie or not. The Company does not use cookies to collect or manage any information that
                                would allow the identification of the user. For further information, please read our Cookie Policy,

                                OxMiner will only collect and retain personal data that is
                                relevant to the purposes for which the data is collected, and we will not use it in a way that is
                                incompatible with such purposes unless such use has been subsequently authorized by you. We will
                                take
                                reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete
                                and
                                current. We may occasionally contact you to determine that your data is still accurate and current.
                                To
                                secure your personal information processed we save your personal information to backup archives in
                                every

                                5. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                We will retain your personal data for so long as it is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in
                                this
                                Policy or until you withdraw your consent, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted
                                by
                                law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements, further for the establishment, exercise or
                                defense of legal claims).
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When we have no longer or no legal basis to process your personal information, we will either delete
                                or
                                anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
                                stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
                                from
                                any further processing until deletion is possible.

                                <br />
                                We will require that these third parties maintain at least the same technical and organizational
                                measures of data protection and confidentiality. Those third parties will never use your personal
                                information for any other purpose except to provide services in connection with the Website and our
                                services.

                                and Google LLC for the purpose of providing services to you. We take steps to ensure adequate
                                safeguards
                                are in place to protect your data, that includes implementing the European Commission’s Standard
                                Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal data between these third party service providers and
                                partners. Please note, that above mentioned companies comply with the EU-US and the EU-Swiss Privacy
                                Shield Frameworks, therefore transfer of your personal data to the aforementioned service providers
                                was
                                deemed safe until July 16, 2020. Please note that according to the judgment no. C-311/18 of the
                                Court of
                                Justice of the European Union, these companies are no longer considered to provide appropriate
                                safeguards for the personal data of European citizens. For more information, you can read the
                                judgment
                                here.

                                6.5 We only transfer personal data collected from individuals located within the EU only with the
                                consent of the individuals to a third-party having a registered seat outside the EU / in the USA
                                acting
                                as a data processor without the appropriate safeguards set out in the GDPR, or when it is necessary
                                for
                                the performance of the contract. OxMiner will make every effort to ensure that the personal data
                                transferred is safe and secure and that the personal data is processed in a manner consistent with

                                be intercepted while being transmitted to us. If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may
                                either post a notice, or attempt to notify you by email and will take reasonable steps to remedy the
                                breach.
